Theoretical Analysis:
This algorithm operates using a recursive formula in the following form: F[i, j] = min(M[i,j], F[i, i+1] + F[i+1, j]), 
where M is the input costMatrix for canoe rentals.

Using this recursive formula, this algorithm will have a worst case runtime of O(n^2), where n is the number of posts along the river.
